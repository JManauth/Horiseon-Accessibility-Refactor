# Horiseon Accessibility Refactor

The purpose of this project was to refactor the HTML and CSS code for Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. 

In this project I refactored the HTML code with the approriate semantic elements, after which i added alt attributes to all of the images. After this, I consolidated the CSS code by grouping any identical code and getting rid of the individual HTML classes.
